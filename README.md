This is a repository for for machine learning projections I am working on.

DPC_V3-1.py

When you run the script it will generate three guassian distributed clusters as well as some outliers. It then attmepts to cluster the 
data and plot the results.
This code may be needed to run a few times as it is not finished. There should be three cluster centers and if the algorithm picks out more or less than 
three cluster centers. In each section there are what needs to be worked on to improve the code.
